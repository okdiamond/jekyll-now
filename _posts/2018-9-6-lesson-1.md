New blog - 
6.9.2018


Starting point: 
We started with our blogs from last year

Target for this lesson? 
The target for this lesson was to create a new blog and delete our old ones

Did I reach my target? (add details to “Lesson Review”) 
I achieved my target.

Lesson Review 

How did I learn? What strategies were effective? In this lesson we were creating new Github blog website. 
The work that Mr Keen  had given us to complete was not difficult, however, it required us to remember (and/or reasearch on) where to, for example, put certain code in the script.
 
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?  
Overall, I did not complete an amazing amount of work because it was very tempting to look for a good background image on google. what I should have done is focoused on the fundamentals of my blog more and looked for pictures when at home.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning? 
I will improve my habit of not being alert by keeping a mental note of my targret and remembering that I can work on my blog at home as well as at school.
