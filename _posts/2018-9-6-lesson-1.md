New blog - 
6.9.2018


Starting point: 
We started with our blogs from last year

Target for this lesson? 
The target for this lesson was to create a new blog and delete our old ones

Did I reach my target? (add details to “Lesson Review”) 
I achieved my target.


How did you use your learning habits this week?	

Persevering:
This week was quite easy so I didn't need to persevere, although overall, I did not complete an amazing amount of work because it was very tempting to look for a good background image on google. What I should have done is focused on the fundamentals of my blog more and looked for pictures when at home.

Questioning:
I didn’t ask any questions as there was not anything I did not understand. I need to question more in general, because I do not put my hand up much in any class

Independence:
I worked on my blog by myself and didn’t need help, exept for W3schools, an amazing website for helping to create a blog.

Reflecting:
I reflected on my old blog design and tried a different colour scheme which I thought was better.

Engagement:
I listened to Mr. Keen when he was talking and helped those around me when they needed help.
