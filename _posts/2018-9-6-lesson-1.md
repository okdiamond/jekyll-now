  <tr>
    <td>Starting point: </td>
    <td>We started with our blogs from last year</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson? </td>
    <td>The target for this lesson was to create a new blog and delete our old ones</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?</td>
    <td>I achieved my target.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?	</td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering:</td>
    <td>This week was quite easy so I didn't need to persevere, although overall, I did not complete an amazing amount of work because it was very tempting to look for a good background image on google. What I should have done is focused on the fundamentals of my blog more and looked for pictures when at home.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning:</td>
    <td>I didn’t ask any questions as there was not anything I did not understand. I need to question more in general, because I do not put my hand up much in any class</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence:</td>
    <td>I worked on my blog by myself and didn’t need help, exept for W3schools, an amazing website for helping to create a blog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting:</td>
    <td>I reflected on my old blog design and tried a different colour scheme which I thought was better.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement:</td>
    <td>I listened to Mr. Keen when he was talking and helped those around me when they needed help.</td>
